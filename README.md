## 📋 Description
This project focuses on building a robust **Predictive Model** to analyze and forecast customer behavior using Machine Learning techniques. By processing historical data, the model identifies hidden patterns and predicts future actions, such as **Churn Prediction**, **Purchase Intent**, and **Customer Segmentation**.

The goal is to empower businesses with data-driven insights to optimize marketing strategies and enhance customer retention.
